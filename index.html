<p>Our pastries are inspired by the seasons, filled with fresh fruit and veggies fresh from the farmers market. Bakery owner Patrick Ascaso sought to recreate the boulangerie of his childhood in Arpajon, France, opening Le Marais Bakery in the Marina neighborhood of San Francisco in July 2013. Since then, this family-owned bakery and bistro has been serving basic French dishes and pastries made with the perfect organic and local elements.</p>
